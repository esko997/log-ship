# Welcome to log-ship!

[log-ship](https://log-ship.com/) is the most versatile log shipper, built for [log-store](https://log-store.com).
log-ship leverages Python scripts to make it *really* easy to parse and filter logs, before sending them to
log-store, or any other log analytics platform.

To get started, check out the [log-ship.com](https://www.log-ship.com) site, or browse the code. Please file
issues when you find them, and PRs if you have fixes.

--Thanks, the log-store team
