# Downloading log-ship

log-ship is provided in `deb` and `rpm` packages, and also as a `tar.gz` archive. Downloading and installing via either
the `deb` or `rpm` package is recommended.

Installing via the `tar.gz` archive is a much more manual process. The archive simply provides all the files in a
common directory layout, but you are responsible for moving and installing things such as the systemd unit files.

## `deb` Package

Download the `deb` package, and install via:

```shell
sudo dpkg -i log-ship.deb
```
